## Robert

Robert is a Robotics Programming Sim/Video Game made with Unity.

### DIY Programming
 - Most programming games are aimed at beginners / "learn to code"
 - Robert is aimed at folks who are fairly comfortable with programming
 - Players write/execute their scripts externally, not within the game
 - Player scripts communicate with an in-game TCP server via a custom API for controlling the bots
 - The provided scripting framework is written in Python, but any language can be used
